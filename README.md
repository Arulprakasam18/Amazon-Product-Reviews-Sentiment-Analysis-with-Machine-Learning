Amazon-Reviews-using-Sentiment-Analysis
Applying sentiment analysis on Amazon's product reviews.


Product reviews are becoming more important with the evolution of traditional brick and mortar retail stores to online shopping. Consumers are posting reviews directly on product pages in real time. With the vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity to see how the market reacts to a specific product. We will be attempting to see if we can predict the sentiment of a product review using machine learning tools, particularly the Support Vector Machine.

The dataset I will be using is from www.kaggle.com.

I have also provided the direct link below if you wish to view the dataset I used to build my model:
